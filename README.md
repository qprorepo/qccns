Abstract 
This project implements and reproduces experiments for an operatorâ€“algebraic QCNN pipeline that integrates symmetry-preserving padding, quantum phase estimation (QPE), and amplitude amplification (AA). Benchmarks include MNIST and FashionMNIST (reported peak accuracies in manuscript: MNIST 98.7%, FashionMNIST 94.7%). The repository provides scripts to (i) prepare and preprocess datasets, (ii) run simulator and small-hardware experiments, (iii) collect resources and noise logs, and (iv) reproduce tables and figures from the manuscript.
