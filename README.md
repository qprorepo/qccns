This research validates quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) within a cohesive operator-algebraic framework that incorporates padding, quantum phase estimation (QPE), and amplitude amplification (AA). We present isometric padding operators Vp that integrate input images into expanded Hilbert spaces while maintaining spatial symmetries through commutator constraints ashN µ exp   2πiQˆµ Dµ   , UQCNNi = 0, where Qˆ µ = 1 2 (xˆµpˆµ + pˆµxˆµ). Quantum convolution (QuC) is implemented using controlled-phase gates to achieve frequencydomain Hadamard products. QPE enhances feature extraction by boosting spectral components, with a mean intensity shift ∆µ = +3.71 for MNIST. AA employs Grover iterations to improve feature subspaces by reducing noise and enhancing separability. Entanglementenhanced convolution uses the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism for kernel-input correlation. Testing on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets demonstrates this model achieves top-tier performance: 98.3% accuracy on MNIST and 94.7% on FashionMNIST. Spectral resolution achieves ∆ξmin ≥ 0.018¯h, matching classical CNNs in precision. This operator framework guarantees geometric invariance and size-agnostic processing, with fidelity bounds defined as ε(P, D¯) = e −κP 2 + Q ζ Dα µ .
